# poker-game


The project is divided in three parts:
	game-back-end: Based in python
	game-front-end: Based in Vue.js 
	game-db.bak: Database in SQL Server

I try to use Docker, but I ran out of time. 
I created an api, called api/players-to-play, this api saves the four player names in the database.
